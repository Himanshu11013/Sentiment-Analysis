Sentiment Analysis on Reviews using VADER and RoBERTa
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using two different methods: the VADER sentiment analysis tool and the RoBERTa transformer model.
By comparing the results of these two approaches, we can better understand the nuances of sentiment expressed in textual data.



Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment of product reviews and provide insights into customer opinions. We utilize two different methodologies for sentiment classification:

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is particularly good for short texts such as tweets and product reviews.
RoBERTa: A state-of-the-art transformer model that provides robust context-aware embeddings and has been shown to outperform traditional models on various NLP tasks.
The project aims to compare the outcomes of both methods to assess their effectiveness in determining sentiment from product reviews.

Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following technologies:

Python: The primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and graphical representation of results.
NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for working with human language data.
Transformers: A library by Hugging Face that provides pre-trained models and tools for NLP.
Torch: A deep learning framework used for training and evaluating the RoBERTa model.


Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of Amazon product reviews. The reviews include several attributes, such as:

Id: Unique identifier for each review.
Text: The text content of the review.
Score: The star rating associated with the review (1 to 5).
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named Reviews.csv. For this project, the first 500 rows are used for analysis.

Data Exploration
The initial exploration involves:

Checking the shape of the dataset.
Visualizing the distribution of review scores using a bar plot.




Future Improvements
Enhanced Model Performance: Investigate additional models and techniques for improved sentiment classification accuracy.
Data Augmentation: Utilize a larger dataset for better generalization of the model.
Real-time Predictions: Implement a web interface to allow users to input reviews and receive sentiment predictions in real-time.
Error Handling: Improve the error handling mechanism during text processing for robustness.
